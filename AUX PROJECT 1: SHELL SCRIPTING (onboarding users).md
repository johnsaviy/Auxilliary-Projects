## AUX PROJECT 1: SHELL SCRIPTING

In this project, I'll onboard 20 new Linux users onto a server. 
I'll Create a shell script that reads a csv file that contains the first name of the users to be onboarded.

#### STEP 1
I'll Create the project folder called Shell  and Create a csv file name names.csv ans insert the names of the users to be onboarded into it.

#### Step 2: After that  we write a script to automate the task.
I'll create a .sh file (onboarding_users.sh) to write the script in it.
